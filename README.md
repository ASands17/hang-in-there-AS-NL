# Iteration 2

1. On the new poster form view, users should be able to fill out the three input fields and then hit the Show My Poster button

2. When the Show My Poster button is clicked, several things will happen:

- [ ] Use the values from the inputs to create a new instance of our Poster class (part of your data model)

- [ ] Save the submitted data into the respective arrays (image URL into the images array, etc - all part of your data model) so that future random posters can use the user-created data

- [ ] Change back to the main poster view (hiding the form view again)

- [ ] Use the new instance of the Poster class (part of your data model) to display the newly created poster image, title, and quote in the main view on the DOM
